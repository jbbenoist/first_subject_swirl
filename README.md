## Description
Your job is to get your hand on the basic of front end development: HTML, CSS.
You have to create a CV/resume: the more basic the better (it does not mean ugly ðŸ˜‰).

If this is your introduction to front development, do not use any libraries (like 
bootstrap for example) but you can use basic Javascript, no jQuery allowed.
If this is not your first lap, have fun ðŸš€.

The architecture provided is just my way to architecture file types.

HTML and CSS are fundamental: you can't expect doing front end without having an
understanding of the HTML tags layout and css properties and selectors.
Do not underestimate those two languages because even without any Javascript, you
can actually do a lot (especially with HTML5).

## Usage
Open ``index.html`` in your favorite browser.
